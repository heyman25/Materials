    "In mathematics, a complex number $z$ is a number that can be expressed in the form $$x+iy$$ where $x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $i$ is a symbol called the **imaginary unit** such that $i^2=-1$. For example, $2+3i$, $-5-i$, $i=0+1i$, $1.5=1.5+0i$ are all complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $z=x+iy$ is a complex number, $x$ is called the real part of $z$ and is denoted as $\\text{Re}(z)$, while $y$ is called the imaginary part of $z$ and is denoted as $\\text{Im}(z)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A complex number $z=a+ib$ can thus be identified with an ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers, which in turn may be interpreted as coordinates of a point in a two-dimensional space. Thus, we can plot complex numbers on a Cartesian plane where the horizontal (labelled as $\\text{Re}$) axis is generally used to display the real part, with increasing values to the right, and the imaginary part marks the vertical (labelled as $\\text{Im}$) axis, with increasing values upwards.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since a complex number is a point on a 2D plane, it makes sense to talk about the distance of the complex number $z$ from the origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $z=x+iy$, then the distance of the complex number number from the origin is called the *modulus of $z$*, denoted as $|z|$ and thus, $$|z|=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the angle subtended between the positive real axis and the line segment $Oz$ in a **counterclockwise sense**, is called the *argument of $z$* and is denoted as $\\text{arg}(z)$. Note that we will define $-\\pi<\\arg(z)\\leq \\pi$. In other words, if the complex number is located in quadrant 3 and 4, the argument of the complex number will be a negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the ideas of modulus and argument clearer, observe the following diagram. We have $z=x+iy$, $|z|=r$ and $\\arg(z)=\\varphi$. \n",
